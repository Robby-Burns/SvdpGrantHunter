# 🎛️ Configuration Control - Cost-Aware Scaling & Multi-Environment

**Version:** 1.3.0 | **Updated:** February 19, 2026 | **Part:** 8/9  
**Status:** Production Ready ✅  
**Purpose:** Control system behavior via configuration (`scale.yaml`), not code changes.

---

## 📍 Purpose

This file teaches you to build **cost-aware, scalable systems** where you change `scale.yaml` to scale from $20/mo → $500+/mo. No code rewrites needed.

**Core Philosophy:** "Configuration as Code. Costs as Data."

---

## 🎛️ The Control File: `scale.yaml`

Create `config/scale.yaml` as your single source of truth:

```yaml
# 🎛️ SYSTEM CONTROL PANEL

deployment:
  tier: "small"                 # Options: learning, small, growing, enterprise
  environment: "dev"            # Options: dev, staging, prod

# 🧠 CONTEXT MANAGEMENT (New in 1.3.0)
context_management:
  max_history_messages: 20
  truncation_strategy: "summarize_oldest" # Options: summarize_oldest, drop_oldest, strict_cutoff
  rag_top_k_results: 5

# 🎼 ORCHESTRATION ENGINE (New in 1.3.0)
orchestration:
  engine: "antigravity"           # Options: antigravity, simple_async, langgraph, crewai
  max_steps: 15                 # Prevent infinite loops

# 🤖 LLM INTELLIGENCE
llm:
  primary:
    provider: "anthropic"       # Switch via Agnostic Factory
    model: "claude-3-5-sonnet"
  routing:
    simple_tasks: "claude-3-haiku"
    critical_tasks: "claude-3-opus"

# 💾 DATA PERSISTENCE
database:
  type: "postgresql"            # Options: sqlite, postgresql, qdrant

# 📄 WORKERS & ASYNC SCALING
workers:
  enabled: false                # Redis/Celery background tasks

# 💰 BUDGET GUARDRAILS
cost_controls:
  hard_limit_usd: 50.00
  alert_threshold_usd: 40.00
```

## ⚙️ Implementation: Python + Pydantic

Ensure your configuration loads reliably and fails fast if incorrect:

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from pydantic import BaseModel
import yaml, os

class OrchestrationConfig(BaseModel):
    engine: str
    max_steps: int

class AppConfig(BaseSettings):
    orchestration: OrchestrationConfig
    
    @classmethod
    def load(cls, yaml_path: str = "config/scale.yaml"):
        with open(yaml_path) as f:
            config_data = yaml.safe_load(f)
        return cls(**config_data)

# Crash immediately if config is broken
config = AppConfig.load()
```
