# COMPLIANCE_REQUIREMENTS.md (Compliance Officer)

## Organizational Alignment
- **Mission Compliance:** All generated grants must support SVdP's mission of serving the poor.
- **Grantor Restrictions:** Ensure the system does not apply for grants with criteria SVdP cannot meet (e.g., religious restrictions vs. service availability).

## Data Retention
- Scouted URLs are kept for 12 months.
- Draft payloads are deleted 90 days after completion/rejection.
- Original PII-containing source docs are NEVER stored in the system.
