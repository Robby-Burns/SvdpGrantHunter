## Project: SVdP Grant Hunter & Writer
**Current Status:** Phase 1 (MVP) Implementation complete. Agnostic factories for LLMs, Databases, and Orchestration are in place. Core agents (Scout and Writer) are functional.

## Recent Accomplishments
- Implemented **Agnostic Factories** (`LLMFactory`, `DBFactory`, `OrchestratorFactory`) for vendor independence.
- Integrated **Risk Guardrails** (PII scrubbing, web sanitization) to level 8/17 security requirements.
- Developed **LangGraph core** (`graph.py`, `scout.py`, `writer.py`) for cyclic/stateful orchestration.
- Created Human-in-the-Loop node for volunteer review.

## Active Goals
- **Deployment:** Preparing `Dockerfile` and `railway.json` for cloud launch.
- **Maintenance:** Monitoring `BUGS.md` (3 items tracked, 1 resolved).
- **Status:** All core features (Scout, Writer, UI, Export) are functional and verified (5/5 tests passing).

## Strategic Direction
The system aims to augment SVdP Pasco volunteers by automating the search and drafting of local grants, strictly adhering to **RAG Confinement** to prevent financial or reputational hallucinations.
