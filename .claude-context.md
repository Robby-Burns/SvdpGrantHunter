## Project: SVdP Grant Hunter & Writer
**Current Status:** Phase 1 (MVP) Implementation complete. Agnostic factories for LLMs, Databases, and Orchestration are in place. Core agents (Scout and Writer) are functional.

## Recent Accomplishments
- Implemented **Agnostic Factories** (`LLMFactory`, `DBFactory`, `OrchestratorFactory`) for vendor independence.
- Integrated **Risk Guardrails** (PII scrubbing, web sanitization) to level 8/17 security requirements.
- Developed **LangGraph core** (`graph.py`, `scout.py`, `writer.py`) for cyclic/stateful orchestration.
- Created Human-in-the-Loop node for volunteer review.

## Active Goals
- **Deployment & QA:** Resolving `ModuleNotFoundError` on Railway by standardizing package structure (`__init__.py`) is **COMPLETED**. Local UI and DB connection crashing bugs (B-005, B-006) discovered during QA are also **COMPLETED**. We are fully production-ready.
- **Maintenance:** Tracking production stability and addressing `BUGS.md`.
- **Master Docs:** 100% compliant documentation suite generated in `/docs/end-of-build/`.

## Strategic Direction
The system aims to augment SVdP Pasco volunteers by automating the search and drafting of local grants, strictly adhering to **RAG Confinement** to prevent financial or reputational hallucinations.
